# FAST REACT PIZZA CO.

Simple way of allowing customers to order pizzas and get them delivered to their home.


 <h2>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS: </h2> <br/>
 👉Very simple application, where users can order one or more pizzas from a menu <br/>
 👉Requires no user accounts and no login: users just input their names before using the app <br/>
 👉The pizza menu can change, so it should be loaded from an API <br/>
 👉Users can add multiple pizzas to a cart before ordering <br/>
 👉Ordering requires just the user’s name, phone number, and address <br/>
 👉If possible, GPS location should also be provided, to make delivery easier <br/>
 👉User’s can mark their order as “priority” for an additional 20% of the cart price <br/>
 👉Orders are made by sending a POST request with the order data (user data + selected pizzas) to the API <br/>
 👉Payments are made on delivery, so no payment processing is necessary in the app <br/>
 👉Each order will get a unique ID that should be displayed, so the user can later look up their order based on the ID <br/>
 👉Users should be able to mark their order as “priority” order even after it has been place <br/>
